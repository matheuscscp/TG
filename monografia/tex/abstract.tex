Boolean satisfiability is a problem of great practical interest and the first NP-complete problem ever found. Many algorithms for this problem are based on normal forms. Also, the naive translations to normal forms may bring exponential growth to the size of a formula, an effect highly undesirable. It is known, though, that techniques such as formula renaming may help reducing the size of the translation. In this work, we present an heuristic to find renamings that may reduce the size of translated formul\ae \; and a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the renaming given by the heuristic, together with its proof of correctness, complexity analysis and experimental results. We also present comparison results with a greedy algorithm for the same problem.
